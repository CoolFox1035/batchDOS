# batchDOS
The compiled version wouldn't be possible without a batch compiler.
This is batchDOS, packed with a file explorer, commands you would usually use, and **even** uses 1 variable!

To download, check releases.

### Info
It is **not** a DOS emulator, It is incompatible with existing DOS programs.

##### Plans:
Improved file explorer
